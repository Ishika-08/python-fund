    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise or random fluctuations. Consequently, it fails to generalize to new, unseen data .i.e. high accuracy for training data and low accuracy for testing data. It has low bias and high variance.\n",

    "1. Cross-validation: Employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on multiple train-test splits of the data. This helps assess the model's generalization capability.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Feature selection: Focus on the most relevant features and eliminate irrelevant or noisy ones to prevent the model from overfitting to irrelevant patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropout: Implement dropout layers in neural networks during training to randomly deactivate some neurons. This prevents complex co-adaptations on the training data, thus reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Early stopping: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop the training process when the performance starts to degrade. This helps prevent the model from overfitting as it continues to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ensemble methods: Use techniques like bagging and boosting to combine multiple models, thereby reducing overfitting by averaging out individual model errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Data augmentation: Increase the size of the training dataset by generating additional data points using techniques like flipping, rotating, or adding noise to the existing data. This helps the model learn more generalizable patterns.\n",
